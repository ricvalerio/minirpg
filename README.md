An experimental project on the implementation of an Entity-Component-System. The game tries to follow a data-driven architecture, via entity definitions and Lua scripting. It supports some basic functionalities, which allows the creation of simple quests, killing monster, picking items, playing music, and some more.

It's a work in progress, and as such, forking and using the code must be taken with a grain of salt. It is an experiment on implementating ECS with lua scripting.
